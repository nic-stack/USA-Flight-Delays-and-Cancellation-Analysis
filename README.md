USA Flight Delay and Cancellation Analysis Dashboard
Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard designed to visualize and analyze patterns in USA flight delays and cancellations. Leveraging real-world airline data, the dashboard identifies key factors and trends contributing to flight performance issues, offering insights into air travel efficiency.

Business Problem
Flight delays and cancellations cause significant inconvenience and economic impact for travelers and airlines alike. Understanding the underlying causes and patterns is crucial for improving operational efficiency, enhancing customer satisfaction, and making informed decisions in the aviation industry. This dashboard provides a visual tool to explore these complex dynamics.

Solution
The solution is an interactive Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx) that allows users to explore various aspects of flight performance data. It transforms raw flight data into actionable visualizations, making it easier to identify:

Common causes of delays and cancellations: Such as weather, carrier issues, security, or national airspace system problems.

Performance by airline: Comparing on-time performance across different carriers.

Impact of specific airports: Identifying airports with higher rates of delays or cancellations.

Trends over time: Analyzing how delays and cancellations fluctuate seasonally or over longer periods.

Technologies Used
Data Visualization & Business Intelligence: Tableau

Data Analysis: Python (for initial data preparation, as indicated in the broader project context)

Data Source: Real-world airline data (as part of the larger analysis project)

How to Access and Use the Dashboard
This dashboard is provided as a Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx).

To view and interact with this dashboard, you must have Tableau Desktop software installed on your computer.

Download the Dashboard File:

Due to its size, the dashboard file is hosted on external cloud storage.

Click here to download the dashboard file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b98B0e3ZuRwate7aDt8QkTPwpDKeM9fm/view?usp=sharing

Open in Tableau Desktop:

Once downloaded, open the .twbx file using your Tableau Desktop application.

The dashboard will open, allowing you to filter, sort, and interact with the visualizations to gain deeper insights into USA flight delays and cancellations.

Note on Large File Size
The Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx) often includes the underlying data, making the file size larger than GitHub's direct upload limits (typically 100 MB per file). To ensure accessibility, the .twbx file is hosted on external cloud storage and linked directly from this README.
